Turns Simple Multi-Touch's JavaDoc comments into the reference HTML pages.

Simple Multi-Touch needs to be put into a folder called "SMT". This folder then needs to be put into the parent directory (../) of "SMT-Web".

Run "createHTML.bat" to remove old reference HTML pages, and replace them with new versions.
